    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project uses the Amazon Appliances [reviews dataset](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) to develop a sentiment analyzer classification model. By combining star ratings and textual content, the model is trained to predict whether a review leans positively or negatively towards a product. This approach offers a way to quickly grasp the general sentiment of a product and assist shoppers in filtering through large volumes of product feedback more efficiently."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem aims to distinguish between favourable and unfavourable appliance reviews based on their text and accompanying reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spending time reading review after review on a product becomes a burden. It is easy to misinterpret the mood behind a set of comments online which can easily lead to poor purchase decisions. A quick, automated sentiment indicator can ease the burden and establish a neutral decision making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What have Others Done in this Space?\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have performed [sentiment analysis](https://medium.com/@nafisaidris413/a-beginners-guide-for-product-review-sentiment-analysis-0de1f451167d) using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to automatically classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Not only has sentiment analysis been applied to product reviews, it has also been applied to [social media](https://buffer.com/social-media-terms/sentiment-analysis) to determine how people perceive and talk about products and brands. This proves that data-driven classifiers are able to provide sentiment analysis scores for assist people in their daily lives, whether its to determine how their personal brand is viewed or how a to make an informed purchase through product review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existing gaps?\n",
    "\n",
    "Current solutions rely on product ratings to provide consumers with a sense of trust and quality to help them make purchasing decisions. This can be seen simply by going to any Amazon product and checking the reviews. Some reviews are informative with many positives about the product, though the product receives less than a rating of 5-stars, or the review is not informative whatsoever with a rating of 5-stars. Other times the reviews are clearly biased or the customer who leaves the review is disgruntled, leading to a 1- or 2-star rating. Using a combination of product star rating and textual review content, we are attempting to reveal patterns in product reviews that a rating alone might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Analysis Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does text-based features add value beyond just a numerical rating?\n",
    "2. Are there certain words which portray a stronger positve or negative sentiment?\n",
    "3. How will adding text preprocessing impact accuracy?\n",
    "4. Which models work best with this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Proposed\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proposing a text classification pipeline that merges a product's star rating and textual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are your Main Findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine customer opinion on various products within the Appliance category in Amazon's online store."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration of Data Features and Refinement of Feature Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focused on understanding the raw data collected from the collected [datasets](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) and transform them into a format suitable for model training. We begin by loading the Amazon Appliance reviews dataset and its corresponding metadata. We will explore the structure of the data, examine the distribution of fields we are interested in (like ratings), and assess the overall quality of the text reviews associated with the products. After we gain a thorough understanding, we apply a series of preprocessing techniques to clean and refine the text data. The goal here is to ultimately develop a set of features that can be fed into a machine learning model for sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Data:**\n",
    "We will loaf the `Appliances.jsonl` (reviews) and `meta_Appliances.jsonl` (metadata) using Apache Spark to avoid memory overload\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial Inspection and Basic Statistics:**\n",
    "We will look at a few sample rows, check data types, count missing values, and examine distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Textual Data Exploration:**\n",
    "We consider the nature of each review such as its length, the character composition, and common words. This should help guide our text cleaning decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "We clean the text by methods such as lowercasing the characters, removing punctuation, stripping leading and/or trailing whitespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Transformation:**\n",
    "We will use Spark Machine Learning's feature extraction tools to convert raw text into numeric features that are typically suitable for machine learning models."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are provided in `*.jsonl` format, which means each line is a separate JSON object representing a single review or product's metadata. We will use `SparkSession` to read the files which will handle the data in a distributed manner, effectively avoiding a potential kernel crash. Spark's lazy evaluation, transformations, and actions will manage memory usage of the large `.jsonl` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main data sources:\n",
    "1. **Review File (`Appliances.jsonl`):**\n",
    "Contains user-level reviews with fields such as `rating`, `title`, `text`, and `helpful_vote`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metada File (`meta_Appliaces.jsonl`):**\n",
    "Contains product-level information like `main_category`, `average_rating`, and `price`."

      "|We don't have any ice maker in our freezer and no place for trays.  So, this is the solution.  We run it all the time.  It actually saves on soda and other beverages with the children.  The ice cubes are not rock hard.  It is more like shaved ice in cube form.With Spring already here and Summer quickly coming all our drinks now have ice.  The phone APP is ok for time settings, but I just leave this run.We had a smaller Ice maker that took up less counter space, but it didn't keep the ice as cold as this one.  So, the ice would melt quickly and the machine had to keep running.  This one seems more energy efficient.  The side water tank makes this a no hassle ice machine.Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)

      "|The Apusafe MWF water filters fit my GE fridge perfectly. Usually I get these from my local home improvement store, however, I will order them on Amazon from now on. Why? You get two for the price of one. This two pack costs $26 on Amazon and I usually pay around $40 for just one.

      "|I bought this to take on an extended cruise with me. I knew that it didn’t hold very much and accepted that. It doesn’t hold much, but it washes a lot less than it holds. Just one pair of thin Capri pants was too much for it. It would start to wash it and then it would quit and start beeping. Even T-shirts and underwear wouldn’t wash most of the time without setting off the limit alarm. And then when you actually got something washed, and you tried to use the spin cycle, all the stuff would fly out of the spin basket. The basket needs a lid. It also needs to be bigger. I ended up wrapping rubber bands around it to keep the clothes in but that’s kind of ridiculous at the price point for this item. Another annoyance is the fact that the lid won’t stay on when you store it vertically. I don’t know how difficult it would’ve been to make the lid snap into place, but that would’ve been a big help as it rattles a lot when the machine is working as well. Like I said, I loved the idea but the actual product does not meet expectations.

      "|This particular egg holder holds even jumbo size eggs.  I was very happy with that.  Now I can see when I'm low on eggs with opening a carton.  Also, I can see which end the eggs are in so I don't drop the carton if the eggs left are in the far end.  Because of the sturdy top, I can stack other items on top without worry that it my crack the tops of eggs in the styrofoam containers my eggs come in from the store.  I always wondered why folks got these instead of using the store container.  Now I understand and recommend this one.

      "|This solved my NO ICE problem in my LG Frig.It should be easy to install, but it is not because it is very difficult to reach in my Lower Freezer unit.If you are overweight, then you might want to leave this one to the pros as you just can't contort yourself into the needed position to install this.But once you get it in, it works just like new.

      "|I personally don't drink coffee but my Mom has 2 of these that she used before I bought this order and I assumed since she was using them, they were okay.  But apparently they don't work well with the Keurig and she had a very difficult time getting them to fit in the spot for the pod.  So these have been returned.  Sorry ANF Distribution but I got your email after this item was already returned and I'm not sure what you could have done to fix the issue if the pods did not fit, but thank you.

      "|I am regretting that I bought this Bosch B26FT70 French door refrigerator with bottom freezer from a non-amazon.com seller (appliancesconnection.com).  This expensive appliance started making a loud humming noise intermittently, within 1 week after installation.  When I called the warranty service the tech takes a whole 8 days to arrive just to tell me that he cannot hear anything wrong with the fridge and leaves.  Called back for warranty service and was told that a specialist would look at it.  Meanwhile the steel trim on the large shelve came off due to shoddy manufacturing.By now it is almost another week later and the specialist comes in and validates that the evaporator motor is defective.  He is going to order the part and put it in when it arrives.  And he said that the shelf has to be replaced because of the trim problem.This whole experience tells me that Bosch is just resting on its laurels.  Their product is simply shoddy with multiple problems.  Bosch's service is slow and unresponsive.  They should not be expecting a customer of a premium appliance, specially a refrigerator that is so essential for today's household, to wait for weeks for warranty repairs on a brand new appliance.I will update this and let you know how long it finally took to get these issues resolved.My advice is to AVOID, AVOID, AVOID this shoddy product.  My old inexpensive GE worked better for years, just threw it out only because we wanted matching appliances.Update on Feb 18, 2013,*********************The saga continues, as per my previous review, this refrigerator started failing almost from the get-go.After numerous problems with loud rattles and falling off trim continued, now the fridge stopped cooling and is completely dead. I used to be a fan of Bosch, but I honestly cannot recommend this \"top of the line\" fridge to even my worst enemy.Bosch's service is another story, this fridge spoiled my food thrice due to misdiagnosis and refusal to take care of the issue. The fridge is currently non-operational for over a week. It takes several days for Bosch's service reps to even come and misdiagnose the issue. These so called experts have repeatedly misdiagnosed the problems. At this point I have an expensive boat anchor in my kitchen.Feel free to buy it if you can afford to live without your primary fridge for weeks at a time.

This expensive mistake stopped working again.  Our first clue to a problem was the big puddle of water in the refrigerator trays and shelves.  The puddles were from the melting ice from the ice maker.  We soon realized that the refrigerator is not cooling and not operational.  Another $150 of spilt food, thanks to Bosch! Called Bosch service again and went through the rigmarole of providing a dated receipt for the 3rd time -based on the number of times I had to call Bosch, I think they should know me and my fridge on a first name basis by now!The Bosch agent gave the contact information of local Bosch authorized service companies.  Frankly I am dreading this call to the local service companies based on my previous experience with these guys.  In my opinion the technicians are incompetent and unprofessional since it takes them multiple attempts to identify the real problem all the while I am sitting without a fridge and forced to pay high bills for restaurant food.  Also, in my previous attempt to repair the fridge, the tech neglected to order the necessary part making us sit with this boat anchor for an additional few days.During my previous repair incident in Feb 2013, I asked Bosch to replace or refund the cost of the fridge since.  Bosch was very unsympathetic to my request.  Today,  I have requested Bosch to replace my dead fridge again and I am waiting to hear from them.  Question for the consumer lawyers amongst you:  I feel cheated by Bosch, what are my options, legal and otherwise?Update on June 15, 2013************************Week 2 and the fridge still not fixed. Bosch does not even bother!|(5000,[0,5,10,13,14,17,18,19,23,25,28,30,33,35,38,39,40,44,48,50,51,52,54,56,68,71,72,88,97,98,100,101,105,106,107,117,119,120,124,127,128,131,133,136,139,146,156,157,160,161,163,174,180,191,192,194,208,209,216,222,223,225,227,232,240,241,242,245,262,290,300,304,307,309,312,319,331,340,342,344,348,359,360,368,374,376,384,387,390,391,393,400,403,412,420,422,431,457,460,465,475,522,528,531,535,562,567,570,572,583,610,631,635,658,662,663,667,668,682,721,728,745,773,782,815,819,824,832,881,896,902,925,937,970,984,986,992,1019,1030,1074,1175,1238,1267,1288,1353,1365,1398,1451,1480,1485,1551,1567,1624,1643,1694,1830,2058,2063,2103,2208,2360,2378,2398,2449,2465,2480,2576,2615,2628,2686,2712,2733,2768,2769,2824,2897,2992,3167,3203,3383,3454,3505,3529,3564,3647,3747,3831,3879,4214,4620,4824,4957],[35.670738696239674,2.532537801276672,6.104577981296334,2.623721169746781,2.7576589395897395,2.9734476185571106,6.12327775335676,2.8695306132293332,3.0254297215978982,3.034550498706817,3.0577383750293525,6.101857509328471,3.2006154328921204,6.396861781729238,3.396880406505048,16.81194462019511,3.3248675752372225,3.3552788667558784,3.4633657006512806,3.4763777479991105,3.4546735490700287,6.952786312876626,3.438090859369514,6.957846716397088,56.369956283065704,7.25185872774316,18.842742824821364,3.766651774506297,3.8476200925433757,3.7852168313827685,3.793032251241679,3.850975950540876,15.592678236674171,11.66093787479771,4.142677474439173,3.9617468985108464,7.927854646357833,3.9460239680876694,3.98090583156058,4.149239019772212,8.015399227957378,8.041466135220627,8.032827499729805,4.031466050098344,8.113383266763806,8.231486414902626,4.229729761765624,4.110442327094436,4.1843335750668125,4.172735006011568,4.1949612691103075,4.246029987384326,4.4855663174788845,17.143334819131592,44.17867769338898,8.839452350407646,8.758172505806824,8.771287806914206,4.440884848756337,4.411174567454913,4.404214073236329,8.90167601853658,9.454602230599775,13.355332482763725,4.455749409473686,4.52444047024055,4.5019314813466265,8.927233633914199,4.526684251291468,4.656748390875836,18.707456337913616,4.782861738496446,4.720969263280078,4.6684544632953235,14.053713161178077,4.701213834366576,4.751878000076565,4.8560989982518254,4.846471235137647,4.778376280301854,4.824815369490749,4.808102216382583,5.128308284398122,9.673149887791054,4.926746433954824,9.724604755572443,14.665368678824148,4.885488209192691,4.894864267743694,4.902339146821746,4.899521522006832,4.954868497738947,4.922615145086034,4.919935667614525,4.97860016369768,4.96062985844108,5.014176063491435,10.15551767145409,10.228519044096835,5.177657286360335,15.88100518184701,5.244173947170619,21.0816810112148,10.514879266513613,10.709143298082779,5.441170762561343,5.368170397265472,5.351753328101932,27.25001395855131,10.85374934285143,5.462163369970648,5.650993885454862,5.474246403320255,5.492244252573901,21.981489330062033,11.03580641630466,5.536228171501109,5.5190907157138005,16.532422874787066,11.216010085699033,11.230085472869867,5.663957156296581,5.656704302060021,5.6740338514031174,11.490060946302624,11.56595410098072,5.845537331615826,5.829688621481653,5.816164023123994,5.905081756422763,5.871395808014598,5.898114300958909,5.9003734034923765,11.904285898846016,5.956733904139769,5.943931973631533,5.982273553074448,5.968397463188381,5.9930947312830725,6.054292145477936,6.13190274818286,6.2490281054202725,59.00666279558889,12.560154338848468,6.328269851897605,6.355594695452684,6.357241690060506,13.131453441702186,6.4236867894686585,19.520745683325977,13.149128607727116,6.541653341669573,6.527873596071556,13.113933114026441,6.6735342965535525,6.700661079284704,6.831650612774157,13.705238965561959,6.881898792974958,6.9651189358013585,7.031340675649756,7.052038582295121,7.060883305515336,7.106319854479753,14.257294913000973,7.110979152367172,7.161259042089247,7.195605221713943,7.184234284286964,7.233150084488975,7.23051503685097,7.2351309369029355,7.27078893598891,7.250449251751787,7.2859721124103,7.307765593576903,7.373868948948011,14.918863600152998,7.533221695952848,7.550285423854251,7.749045706991366,7.577835375622482,7.606165882248708,7.669428079026674,7.6542379135326994,7.6714709806564745,7.728268579049607,7.765759187965106,7.884947705230225,8.156723205382471,8.133733687157772,8.145162382981395])|\n",
